# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members of the ACM@UIUC community pledge to make participation in our community a harrasment-free experience for everyone, regardless of any personal attributes, beliefs or other characteristics.

## Expected Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness towards others
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Ensuring that events and official ACM activities are inclusive and accessible
- Using ACM property and resources in a responsible and respectful manner


## Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include the following:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments and/or personal/political attacks
- Targetted public or private harrasment or doxxing
- Failure to follow posted rules or procedures
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate or unbecoming in an academic setting

## How to Report

Infractions of this Code of Conduct or any other posted ACM rules or guidelines can be reported to an ACM@UIUC officer. Contact information for officers is available on [our website](https://acm.illinois.edu/).

## Enforcement

Conflicts, including breach of the standards for conduct outlined here, will be resolved in a manner consistent with the [ACM@UIUC Constitution](constitution.md), and may result in the revocation of membership priveleges, escalation to outside authorities, or other actions as the ACM officers see fit.
