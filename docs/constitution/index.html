</h1>
<p>This organization shall be called the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Student Chapter of the Association for Computing Machinery herein referred to as ACM@UIUC. All affiliated Special Interest Groups are herein referred to as SIGs. This organization may officially be referred to by any of the following terms:</p>
<ul>

<h2 id=purpose>
Purpose
<a class=anchor href=#purpose>#</a>
</h2>
<p>This organization shall promote an increased knowledge of the science, design, development, construction, languages, management, and applications of modern computing machinery. This organization shall promote communication and interaction between students interested in computing machinery, faculty and staff involved with computing machinery, and computing machinery itself.</p>
<p>Membership in ACM@UIUC shall be open to all current and former students, staff, and faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Membership is received through completion of the official membership form and the payment of requisite dues as prescribed by the Executive Council.

<p>Membership may be revoked from any member demonstrating behavior that is a substantial violation of the official ACM Code of Integrity upon both a three-fourths affirmative vote of the Executive Council followed by a three-fourths affirmative vote of the current Active ACM membership respondents. These votes must be preceded by a hearing in accordance to with the Appeals Process.</p>
<p>Members who have had their membership revoked can be reinstated in the next (or in a future) academic semester by a one-half affirmative vote of the Executive Council.</p>

ACM Temporary Changes
<a class=anchor href=#acm-temporary-changes>#</a>
</h2>
<p>In light of the restrictions on in-person meetings and the likelihood that a large portion of ACM@UIUC Executive Council will be off-campus for the foreseeable future, the ACM@UIUC Executive Council will be granting temporary additional powers to the current ACM@UIUC Chair. These powers shall be used to ensure the operations of ACM@UIUC for the duration of the disruption to the normal operations of the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. The powers granted shall be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to make decisions that would normally require the approval of the executive council. These include, but are not limited to the following:
<ul>
<li>The ability to approve / reject funding requests</li>
<li>The ability to modify the procedure of the ACM elections in such a manner that does not violate the rules of the ACM@UIUC constitution
<ul>
<li>These procedural changes shall be a good faith attempt of the Chair of ACM@UIUC in order to best capture the sentiment of the ACM@UIUC voting population</li>
<li>The currently planned procedure is as follows:
<ul>
<li>All nominated members will deliver their speeches via Zoom</li>
<li>All voting-eligible members will be able to listen to speeches, ask questions, and deliberate or the Zoom call</li>
<li>The desired candidates for each voting-eligible member will be recorded via Google forms (or another similar mechanism) and shared live via a to be determined means</li>
<li>The small set of ACM@UIUC voting members present at elections will cast their votes such that the candidate desired by the majority of the remote membership is elected</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Chair of ACM@UIUC shall make an effort in order to gather the opinions of ACM@UIUC Executive Council in advance of making decisions. This will be done through Slack and / or video conferencing.</p>
<p>In the event of a transition of the position of Chair of ACM@UIUC, these powers shall be transferred to the new Chair of ACM@UIUC. The same provisions regarding the elimination and restriction of these additional powers shall also be transferred over.</p>
<p>These additional powers are intended to only be in effect for the duration of time such there is a disruption to the normal operation of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The following cases will result in these additional powers being removed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The resumption of normal operations of the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign</li>
<li>A two-thirds vote by the ACM@UIUC Executive Council to remove the additional powers</li>
<li>A decision to remove these rights by the Chair of ACM@UIUC</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to provide some limitations to these additional powers which are being temporarily granted to the Chair of ACM@UIUC, the following restrictions will be enforced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Funding requests approved by the Chair of ACM@UIUC without an explicit from ACM@UIUC Executive Council are not to exceed $10,000 per academic year in total. An academic year is defined as starting on August 1st.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Definitions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Normal Operations: The resumption of the ability for ACM@UIUC Executive meetings to occur and meet quorum in order to meet on University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign owned / operated spaces</li>
</ul>
