As the course name suggests, this is the core computer architecture class in the CS(+X) major. The class is comprised of pre-lecture homeworks (preflight assignments), homeworks, in-person group assignments (GAs), lab assignments, and biweekly quizzes. The course is largely served through PrairieLearn, with a large amount of the class being autograded.
