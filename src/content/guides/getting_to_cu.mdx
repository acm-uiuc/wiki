There are a handful of ways to get to UIUC/the Champaign-Urbana (CU) area.

## Bus
Peoria Charter provides regular service from Champaign-Urbana's Armoury, Illinois Terminal, and Illinois Street Residence Hall to downtown Chicago, O'Hare International Airport, and various locations in the Chicagoland area, and vice versa. Tickets are around $45 dollars online. 

There is also a Flixbus that runs from CU's Illinois Terminal to the Greyhound Bus Terminal in Chicago's Union Station and vice versa. If you are coming from/going to O'Hare, you can take the CTA's Blue Line between O'Hare and Clinton Station. There is also a Metra train that runs extremely infrequently between Union Station and O'Hare.

## Train
There is Amtrak service from CU's Illinois Terminal to Chicago's Union Station. As stated before, if you are coming from/going to O'Hare, you can take the CTA's Blue Line between O'Hare to Clinton Station. There is also a Metra train that runs extremely infrequently between Union Station and O'Hare.

## Plane
Willard Airport (CMI) is located in Savoy, just south of CU. American Airlines runs a handful of flights from Willard to O'Hare. United is also set to begin offering four flights a day from Willard to O'Hare after April 30th, 2026. Generally speaking, these flights are significantly more expensive than the above options.
