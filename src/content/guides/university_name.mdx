As per our University's brand guide, the full name of our university is "University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign". There is no "at". There is no "in". In the past, the school /was/ called "University of Illinois *at* Urbana-Champaign", but this has not been the case for about a decade.

Common shortenings for the school's name include "UIUC", "U of I", and simply "Illinois", although use of "UIUC" is discouraged as per the official [brand guide](https://brand.illinois.edu/messaging/name-and-boilerplate).

As an aside, although the school is called "University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign", the metropolitan area it is located in is called "Champaign-Urbana", or simply "CU". It is flipped in our university's name as the university was founded in Urbana and later expanded into Champaign.
